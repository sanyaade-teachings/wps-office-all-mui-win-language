## About the warning "This type of file can damage your computer. Do you want to download ... deb anyway?"

That message is a general warning that appears when downloading executable files, such as `.deb` files on Linux systems. `.deb` files contain installable packages, and if they come from untrusted sources, they could potentially contain malicious software that could damage your system or compromise its security.

The warning does not necessarily mean that the file you are downloading is dangerous, but rather that you should be careful and make sure it comes from a trusted source. It is important to verify the authenticity and provenance of the file before installing it, especially if you are not downloading it from the official repositories of your Linux distribution.

You can also upload it to to check its Reliability to:

üîç [https://virustotal.com](https://virustotal.com) 

---

## 1.) Install deb with right clic
When you right click on the **deb** you should see an option in your file manager to install deb, this on **MX Linux**, **Debian**, **Ubuntu**, but if not in your distro, search on the web how to install **deb** files.

---

## 2.) Install ttf-wps-fonts

These are the symbol fonts required by wps-office. They are used to display math formulas. Since the official download is no longer available I uploaded the file to GitHub:

üîπ **For debian based Linux:**  
üîó [https://github.com/wachin/ttf-wps-fonts/releases/download/1.0/ttf-wps-fonts_1.0_all.deb](https://github.com/wachin/ttf-wps-fonts/releases/download/1.0/ttf-wps-fonts_1.0_all.deb)

üîπ **For rpm**  
üîó [https://github.com/wachin/ttf-wps-fonts/releases/download/1.0/ttf-wps-fonts-1.0_all.rpm](https://github.com/wachin/ttf-wps-fonts/releases/download/1.0/ttf-wps-fonts-1.0_all.rpm)

üîπ **For others Linux**  
üîó [https://github.com/wachin/ttf-wps-fonts/releases/download/1.0/ttf-wps-fonts_1.0.tar.gz](https://github.com/wachin/ttf-wps-fonts/releases/download/1.0/ttf-wps-fonts_1.0.tar.gz)

download the **tar.gz** file and extract it with right clic "**Extract here"**, then copy the folder to:  

üìÇ .fonts  

If this folder does not exist create it. To see hit Ctrl + H to show hidden directories.

---

## 3.) Install Chinese fonts

To work fine this WPS Office Chinese version neet the following fonts:  

- **batang.ttc**  
- **gulim.ttc**  
- **simfang.ttf**  
- **simhei.ttf**  
- **simkai.ttf**  
- **simsun.ttc**

üì• **Download it from GitHub:**

download the **.7z** file and extract it with right clic **"Extract here"**, then copy the folder to:  

üìÇ **~/.fonts** 

If this folder does not exist create it. To see hit **Ctrl + H** to show hidden directories.

## 4.) Install ibus  

This is necessary for special characters like accent marks on Spanish language to can be written, If you need, install with:

```bash
sudo apt install im-config ibus ibus-gtk ibus-gtk3
```

In some more modern Linux the following package goes 

```bash
ibus-gtk4
```

üìå  After installed: **RESTART YOUR COMPUTER**

‚ö†Ô∏è**Note**: If you don't start it it doesn't work.

---

## 5.) Install MUI (Multilingual User Interface)

The **MUI (Multilingual User Interface)** allows you to change the language of  **WPS Office Linux**

üì• **Download from GitHub:**  
üîó [https://github.com/wachin/wps-office-all-mui-win-language/releases/download/v11.1.0.11704/mui.7z](https://github.com/wachin/wps-office-all-mui-win-language/releases/download/v11.1.0.11704/mui.7z)

After downloading the **.7z** file, unzip it and copy it to the following location:

üìÇ **~/.local/share/Kingsoft/office6**  

This folder is hidden. To show it, press **Ctrl + H** in your file explorer.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** The **Kingsoft/office6** folder will only appear after you have opened **WPS Office** for the first time. If you have just installed it and do not see the folder, **open and close the program** so that it is automatically generated.

üìå **This MUI contains:**

After downloading the **.7z** file, unzip it and copy it to the following location:

üìÇ **~/.local/share/Kingsoft/office6**  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Remember** This folder is hidden (hit **"Ctrl + H"** to see) and appear from the first time when you open **WPS Office Linux**, If you have just installed it and have not opened it, open and close it, then the hidden folder appear

Checking the button to change the language of WPS Office:

1. **Open WPS Office**
2. Click **"New Tab"**

![](vx_images/20231030-225131-WPS-Office-clic-create-new-tab.png)

3. Create a new document (Presentation, Excel or Document)

![](vx_images/20231030-225431-Create-a-new-empty-document.png)

4. The first time when you open the language switcher there is only two available:

![](vx_images/20231030-230201-the-first-time-when-you-open-the-language-switcher-there-is-only-two-available.png)

---

## 6.) Install the Fix language selector

The program has a file with incomplete code in:  

üìÇ **/opt/kingsoft/wps-office/office6/mui/lang_list/lang_list_community.json**  

To fix this, first backup the original file with the following command in the terminal:

```bash
sudo cp /opt/kingsoft/wps-office/office6/mui/lang_list/lang_list_community.json /opt/kingsoft/wps-office/office6/mui/lang_list/lang_list_community.json.backup
```

then replace the file with the one with the complete code:

```
wget -c https://github.com/wachin/wps-office-all-mui-win-language/releases/download/v11.1.0.11704/lang_list_community.json && sudo cp lang_list_community.json /opt/kingsoft/wps-office/office6/mui/lang_list/
```

üìå **What does this command do?**
1. Download the corrected file to your **HOME** folder.
2. Then, it will ask you for **superuser** permissions to copy it to the correct location within the system.

If you want to review its content before installing it, copy the line before && and paste it into a terminal and the file will be downloaded and you can open it with a text editor to review it, then use the full line.

For this fix to be visible it is necessary to restart WPS Office, but do not restart it yet, instead continue with the installation of the spell checking dictionaries and then restart it.

![](vx_images/20231030-231301-now-all-the-mui-are-present-to-switch-it.png)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** When there is an update to the program and you have installed it, you must reapply the fix.

---



## 8.) Fix WPS Office fails to save as PDF

On some Linux distributions that use libtiff6 instead of libtiff5, such as:

**MX Linux 23 (Debian 12 based)**  
üîó [packages.debian.org/libtiff6](packages.debian.org/libtiff6)

**Ubuntu 24.04**  
üîó [packages.ubuntu.com/libtiff6](packages.ubuntu.com/libtiff6)

to save to PDF check if you has the package `libtiff6`, and if this is not true, install this with:
```
sudo apt install libtiff6
```
and is necesary create a symbolic link to simulate that this versi√≥n is libtiff5, to do that copy and paste in a terminal:

```
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtiff.so.6 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtiff.so.5 
```
give Enter and Restart WPS Office, and try again.  

üìå **Why is this step necessary?**
WPS Office looks for version **libtiff5**, but on newer versions of Linux, only **libtiff6** is available. This command creates a **symlink** that makes the system "trick" WPS Office into using the available version.

## Origin of Dictionaries and MUI files
If any of you are wondering where I got the **dictionaries** and **MUI** from, it is in the following explanation, which although it has images in Spanish I think you should be able to understand it:

**Where is the files under PlayOnLinux**  
üîó [https://github.com/wachin/wps-office-all-mui-win-language/blob/master/src/PlayOnLinux's%20virtual%20drives/Where%20is%20the%20files%20under%20PlayOnLinux.md](https://github.com/wachin/wps-office-all-mui-win-language/blob/master/src/PlayOnLinux's%20virtual%20drives/Where%20is%20the%20files%20under%20PlayOnLinux.md)

and read:

**Where is the files on Windows 8.1**  
üîó [https://github.com/wachin/wps-office-all-mui-win-language/blob/master/src/C_Windows8.1/Where%20is%20the%20files%20on%20Windows%208.1.md](https://github.com/wachin/wps-office-all-mui-win-language/blob/master/src/C_Windows8.1/Where%20is%20the%20files%20on%20Windows%208.1.md)
